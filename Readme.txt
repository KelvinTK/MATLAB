Hi!

Here are some of my MATLAB projects. I tried not to use any toolboxes in an effort to make everything simple and clear 
(I could have used less code with the help of MATLAB toolboxes but i guess i will do that in the future).
They are mainly composed of lab-works and assignments. Should time allow, i will be adding their SIMULINK models soon.

I am making them public mainly for educational purposes. They cover:
-Digital Filter Design
-Fourier transforms
-Antenna design
-Signal Detection methods and algorithms

Some practical use of digital filters in MATLAB would require me to make some videos but unfotunitely i don't have enough time.
I am, however, going to add SIMULINK models soon.

Should you need help or feel like contacting me for any reason, you can do so via email: kktafadzwa@gmail.com. I will, however, 
respond to emails written in English or Russian languaages only.

I will also add projects for implementation on FPGA (Xilinx Vivado) and probably a few standalone MATLAB applications.

Have fun!!
